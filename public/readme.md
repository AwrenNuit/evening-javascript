# `Evening JavaScript`

## Description

An ever-growing collection of small, quirky, somewhat helpful projects that I code out in a few hours in the evening.  I have a ton of fun making these...even if they are simple and rough around the edges.  I'm always open to suggestions!~

# `Countdown to Halloween 2020`

One evening, I asked my partner what smallish project I should build. She said she wanted a Halloween countdown featuring a pumpkin.

And here it is.

# `What Day Is It?`

Do you find yourself wondering what day it is? Have you ever thought it was a different day than it actually was? Wait until you hear about WHAT DAY IS IT?! All of your problems are at an end. Feel the comforting embrace that only insider knowledge of what day of the week it is can bring.

Find your inner peace.

It's Wednesday my dudes <br />

# `Wild Palette Generator`

This was a short, fun project to inject some more oddness into the world.  Upon pressing the 'gogo' button, five (5) colors are randomly displayed.  They harken back to the internet of old.  They follow no rules. They have no masters.

Relive the 90s.
